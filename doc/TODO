MUST HAVE
---------

Model:
- Unit tests of model layer, especially transaction and account balance
- Convenience functions in Account model to match *transaction_set in group
- Update code with the new Transaction model

  ensure that entries can only be added to unregistered transactions, thus
  ensuring data integrity
- TransactionLog needs to enforce that user is set.

Views:
- Use decorators to control commit/rollback of transactions

Forms:
- More sanity checking, prevent admin from performing transactions that he does
  not have enough privileges to invoke (should be done in form and/or model)

Templates:
- Updated transaction lists and detail views, differentiated for admins and
  users

Views & Templates:
- Use new convenience functions for transaction_sets in Group model

New features:
- Settlement
  * Invoice

- Transaction: strip down
- TransactionLog(transaction, type, timestamp, user, message) instead of
  transaction details and to know who did what to a transaction. Type is

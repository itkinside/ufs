  or credit
- set_reject, etc, need to be aware of placeholders and enfore who is allowed
  to alter state

Views:
- Use decorators to control commit/rollback of transactions

Forms:
- More sanity checking, prevent admin from performing transactions that he does
  not have enough privileges to invoke (should be done in form and/or model)
  * get_valid_choices() must check session user before returning
  * Use get_valid_choices() in "Register transaction"

Templates:
- Updated transaction lists and detail views, differentiated for admins and
  users

Views & Templates:
- Use new convenience functions for transaction_sets in Group model
- Finish rewrite of approve/change transaction state form.

New features:
- Settlement
  * Invoice

  emails, but perhaps messages is enough?

- Transaction: strip down
- TransactionLog(transaction, type, timestamp, user, message) instead of
  transaction details and to know who did what to a transaction. Type is
  registered, payed, received and rejected.
- TransactionEntry(transaction, account, debit, credit) instead of debit/credit
  account and amount on Transaction
- Rename "list item" to "list column" or "list field"?
- Change NewTransaction to Transaction
- Modify Transaction so that we don't automagicly set it as registered, also
  ensure that entries can only be added to unregistered transactions, thus
  ensuring data integrity
- TransactionLog needs to enforce that user is set.
- Admin should be able to edit lists (adamcik)
- Account management, optionally connect with users
- Refactor of lists, statements, invoice etc to report app

WONTFIX
-------

- Custom base.html for each accountgroups lists?
- Account list in admin menu
- Serial number to lists (somewhat in doubt...)
